        <h3>About Drug Discovery @TACC</h3>
        <p>The original idea for this site was from the existing docking portal run at UTMB, Docking At UTMB. In order to scale the size of the docking computations, the portal was rewritten to work with TACC's infrastructure. A collaboration was launched between UTMB and TACC to build the portal infrastructure and docking execution pipeline to run on TACC's high performance computing computational resources. Today, the project continues to expand in technical capability and offerings while supporting an ever-growing community.</p>
